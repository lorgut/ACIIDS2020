The material which is included in this repository is related with the experiments for the ACIIDS 2020 congress.

The material is composed by:

- Definition of the classes
- Definition of the entities
- Query outputs 

## Definition of the classes 
The classes are defined using python programming language. These classes are defined in the GQLapp program, but are included in separate files in order to facilitate the understanding of the ACIIDS 2020 paper. The defined classes are:
- Tutor
- Student
- FinalProject

## Definition of the entities 
The entities, as well as the classes, are defined in the GQLapp program using python. For the sake of understanding the ACIIDS 2020 paper, the definition of the entities are included in this repository in separate files as well as Tables where the relations and values can be easily checked.

## Query outputs 
The query outputs are stored in html files generated by GQLapp program. For each GQL mutation operator a folder is included. In each folder original and mutant query outputs are saved according to the included ACIIDS example.
